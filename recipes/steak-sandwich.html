    <h3>Instructions</h3>

            <ol>

    <li>Garlic Aioli: Mix mayonnaise and garlic together. Set aside for 30 minutes+ for the flavour to develop (do not keep for more than 3 days tops).</li>
    <li>Caramelised Onion: Melt butter in a skillet over medium low heat. Add onions and stir to coat in butter. Place lid on (or place a baking tray over skillet) and leave for 20 minutes, stirring once or twice. Remove lid then cook for a further 20 minutes, stirring every now and then, until onion is golden (increase heat slightly if the colour is not changing). Add sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper. Cook for a further 10 minutes until jammy. Remove from heat and keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>Take beef out of fridge 20 minutes before cooking. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a skillet over high heat (or heat BBQ). Cook steak to your liking - if using a secondary cut like Bavette, skirt or flat iron, it's best medium rare.</li>
    <li>Transfer beef to a plate, cover loosely with foil and rest for 5 - 10 minutes. Then slice thinlyagainst the grain.
    </li>
    <li>Cut turkish bread into 15cm/6" lengths and split into half. Toast lightly.</li>    
    <li>Spread the bottom piece generously with garlic aioli. Top with rocket, then tomato slices, beef, caramelised onion. Spread the top piece of bread with mustard then place on top.</li>     
    
            </ol>
